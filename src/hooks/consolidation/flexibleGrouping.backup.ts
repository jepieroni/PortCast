/*
The original flexible grouping code has been preserved here but commented out
to prevent TypeScript compilation errors. This will serve as reference for
the new flexible consolidation strategy implementation.

Original implementation included:
- Region-based flexibility inheritance
- POE/POD flexible grouping
- Port region membership checks
- Grouped ports tracking

This code will be reviewed and potentially reused when implementing
the new flexible consolidation strategy.
